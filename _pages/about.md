Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the supervision of Professor Marco Canini (KAUST). During my PhD I have visited Professor Anne-Marie Kermarrec lab at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My primary research interests revolve around artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on deep learning and Federated Learning.

In 2022, I attained my M.Sc. in Computer Science from KAUST. In 2020, I received my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in Computer Science and Engineering from the [National School of Computer Science (ENSI)](https://ensi.rnu.tn/). Earlier, I engaged in the study of Mathematics and Physics at the Sfax Preparatory Engineering Institute, University of Sfax, achieving a position within the top 5% in the Tunisian national Mathematics and Physics contest of 2017.
